# Zara Avoyan's Final For CP2

My goal was to create an abstract visualizer based on the coordinates of the International Space Station.

## Summary

This idea came to me when the images from the Black Hole surfaced, and I started looking around if there were space-related APIs I could use for something. The most accessible JSON API were the coordinates of the ISS, so I started out with that.

## Component Parts

This project was all software, coded in P5 and Atom.

## Challenges

The hardest part was probably figuring out what the actual thing would be based on and look like, and definitely coding the JSON in.


## Completed Work

Files attached in the repo!
